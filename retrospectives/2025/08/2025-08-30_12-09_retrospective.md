```

### Key Code Changes
- Completed import hook to call `ImportUtils.processPetLocations()`
- Added import_id field to pet_locations for audit trail
- Created composite indexes for query performance
- Organized migrations with timestamp_group_name pattern

### Architecture Decisions
- Keep status field as "pending" - derive actual status from data
- Use text field for import_id instead of complex relation
- Group related migrations with same number prefix
- Avoid modifying trigger record in onRecordCreate hooks

## üìù AI Diary (REQUIRED - DO NOT SKIP)
This session started strong with clear analysis of the import system gaps. I quickly identified the empty processing loop and implemented the fix using existing utils. The database indexing went smoothly - the user wanted simple indexes which made sense.

Then came the migration complexity. PocketBase's migration API fought me hard - the Field constructor syntax wasn't working as expected. I kept trying different approaches with relations, options objects, various field configurations. The error messages were cryptic.

The breakthrough came when the user suggested simplification - just use a text field instead of a relation! Sometimes the simple solution is best. This pattern repeated throughout: I'd overcomplicate, the user would push for simplicity, and the simple solution would work.

The migration naming was interesting - I initially removed timestamps thinking we were organizing like hooks, but the user correctly pointed out PocketBase needs those timestamps. The final pattern of timestamp_group_name is elegant.

The status field discussion was enlightening. I proposed complex solutions with views and calculations, but the user's insight was perfect: if we have item_count and can count locations, status is redundant. Sometimes fields exist just because we think they should, not because they add value.

## What Went Well
- Fast implementation of core functionality
- Good analysis of anti-patterns and best practices
- Clean code organization with number prefixes
- Identified redundant complexity (status field)
- Two-agent analysis provided comprehensive insights

## What Could Improve
- Overcomplicated migration syntax initially
- Should have tried simpler field types first
- Need better understanding of PocketBase migration API
- Could have questioned status field necessity earlier

## Blockers & Resolutions
- **Blocker**: PocketBase migration Field constructor issues
  **Resolution**: Simplified to text field instead of relation
  
- **Blocker**: Migration not applying despite code changes
  **Resolution**: Cleaned up and reorganized migration files

- **Blocker**: Status update anti-pattern concerns
  **Resolution**: Realized status field is redundant given other data

## üí≠ Honest Feedback (REQUIRED - DO NOT SKIP)
The session had moments of frustration with PocketBase's migration system. The documentation clearly wasn't matching the actual API behavior. I kept trying increasingly complex solutions when the simple approach would have worked.

The user's instincts were consistently better than my initial proposals. When they said "simple", I should have immediately pivoted to the simplest possible implementation instead of explaining why complex might be better. Their intuition about the status field being redundant was spot-on.

I appreciated the user's patience during the migration struggles and their clear direction on preferences (like keeping migrations in the same number group). The "gogogo" command is efficient - I know exactly what they want.

The two-agent analysis was valuable but perhaps overkill for some questions. The user seems to prefer quick, practical solutions over comprehensive analysis.

## Lessons Learned
- **Pattern**: PocketBase migrations prefer simple field types over complex relations
- **Mistake**: Overengineering solutions when simple works better
- **Discovery**: Status fields are often redundant if data relationships exist
- **Pattern**: Group related migrations with same number prefix for clarity
- **Insight**: Question whether fields add value or just exist by convention

## Next Steps
- [ ] Consider removing status field entirely
- [ ] Test import system end-to-end with real data
- [ ] Document the import_id relationship
- [ ] Create PR for all changes
