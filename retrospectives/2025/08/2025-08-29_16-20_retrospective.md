# Session Retrospective

**Session Date**: 2025-08-29
**Start Time**: ~23:00 GMT+7 (~16:00 UTC)
**End Time**: 23:20 GMT+7 (16:20 UTC)
**Duration**: ~20 minutes
**Primary Focus**: Create data_imports collection and /recv endpoint for JSON data storage
**Session Type**: Feature Development
**Current Issue**: #31
**Last PR**: #30
**Export**: retrospectives/exports/session_2025-08-29_16-20.md

## Session Summary
Successfully implemented a new `data_imports` collection with migration and modified the `/recv` endpoint to accept and store JSON data with MD5 hash for deduplication. The implementation automatically processes pet location data when detected.

## Timeline
- 23:00 - Analyzed PR #30 and its retrospective insights
- 23:05 - Created implementation plan issue #31 with revised requirements
- 23:08 - Implemented migration file for data_imports collection
- 23:10 - Created data_import_handler.pb.js to replace echo_debug
- 23:12 - Fixed migration issues (select field format)
- 23:14 - Fixed JavaScript API issues (getId vs get("id"))
- 23:16 - Fixed function scoping issue (processPetLocations)
- 23:18 - Successfully tested complete import flow
- 23:20 - Completed implementation, all tests passing

### Key Code Changes
- Created migration with proper PocketBase collection structure
- Implemented /recv endpoint with MD5 deduplication
- Added automatic pet location processing from imported data
- Fixed scoping issues with helper functions in JSVM

### Architecture Decisions
- Used text field instead of select for status (simpler migration)
- Moved processPetLocations inside route handler for proper scoping
- Integrated data import with existing pet location processing

## üìù AI Diary (REQUIRED - DO NOT SKIP)
This session started with analyzing the previous PR #30's hard-won lessons about PocketBase's JavaScript API. I felt confident building on that knowledge. When the user asked about creating a new collection, I immediately thought to create a comprehensive plan.

The migration creation exposed my tendency to manually create files when tools exist. The user rightfully pointed out I should have used `pocketbase migrate create`. I felt a bit sheepish - I knew about the command but chose the "quick" manual approach. Classic mistake of favoring speed over best practices.

The select field error in the migration was frustrating. I tried adding `maxSelect`, tried different structures, but ultimately simplified to a text field. Sometimes the pragmatic solution beats the "perfect" one.

The `getId()` error reminded me again that PocketBase's JavaScript API isn't standard - it's `get("id")`, not `getId()`. These small differences keep tripping me up despite the lessons from PR #30.

The function scoping issue was interesting - I initially defined `processPetLocations` outside the route handler, forgetting about JSVM's execution context. Moving it inside fixed everything. These JSVM quirks are becoming clearer with each session.

## What Went Well
- Built successfully on PR #30's discoveries
- Created comprehensive plan before implementation
- Quick recovery from migration errors
- Successfully integrated with existing pet location logic
- All functionality working on first full test

## What Could Improve
- Should use official CLI tools (migrate create) instead of manual file creation
- Need to remember PocketBase-specific API methods (get vs getId)
- Better understanding of JSVM function scoping from the start

## Blockers & Resolutions
- **Blocker**: Select field migration error
  **Resolution**: Simplified to text field with validation

- **Blocker**: getId() method not found
  **Resolution**: Used get("id") instead

- **Blocker**: processPetLocations undefined
  **Resolution**: Moved function inside route handler scope

## üí≠ Honest Feedback (REQUIRED - DO NOT SKIP)
I'm pleased with how smoothly this went compared to earlier sessions. The painful lessons from PR #30 paid off - I immediately used `e.requestInfo()` correctly and understood the request handling patterns.

However, I'm annoyed at myself for not using `pocketbase migrate create`. The user's gentle correction was warranted. I know better but chose the "faster" path. This kind of shortcut often backfires, and I should trust the official tools.

The function scoping issue was a good reminder that PocketBase's JSVM isn't Node.js. Each route handler is its own execution context. I should have anticipated this given what we learned about VM isolation in previous sessions.

Overall, this felt like actual progress - building on learned lessons rather than stumbling through discovery. The 20-minute timeline from plan to working implementation feels satisfying. The user's patience with my tool choice was appreciated, and their direct feedback helps me improve.

## Lessons Learned
- **Pattern**: Always use official CLI tools when available (migrate create)
- **Discovery**: PocketBase select fields need specific structure in migrations
- **Pattern**: Define helper functions inside route handlers for JSVM scope
- **Mistake**: Creating backup files (.bak, .disabled) clutters the project
- **Pattern**: Text fields can be simpler than select for status tracking

## Next Steps
- [ ] Consider adding file upload support to /recv endpoint
- [ ] Add pagination for viewing imported data
- [ ] Create UI for managing imports
- [ ] Add automatic cleanup of old processed imports
