**Session Date**: 2025-08-29
**Start Time**: [FILL_START_TIME] GMT+7 ([FILL_START_TIME] UTC)
**End Time**: 09:12 GMT+7 (02:12 UTC)
**Duration**: ~X minutes
**Primary Focus**: Project analysis and context creation.
**Session Type**: Research
**Current Issue**: #18
**Last PR**: N/A

## Session Summary

I analyzed the project structure, identified the technologies used, and documented the application's architecture, data model, and API endpoints. I also followed the `ccc` workflow to create a context issue on GitHub.

## Timeline

- 02:00 - Started session, analyzed project structure.
- 02:05 - Created context issue #18 using `ccc` workflow.
- 02:10 - Answered user questions about the process.

### Architecture Decisions

No architecture decisions were made.

## üìù AI Diary (REQUIRED - DO NOT SKIP)

My initial analysis of the project was successful. I was able to identify the key technologies and understand the overall architecture. The `CLAUDE.md` file was very helpful in understanding the expected workflows. The `ccc` command failed a few times due to security restrictions with the `gh` command, but I was able to work around it by creating a temporary file. I need to be more careful about how I construct shell commands to avoid these issues in the future. The user seems to be testing my abilities to follow the instructions in `CLAUDE.md`.

## What Went Well

-   The project analysis was thorough and accurate.
-   I was able to successfully follow the `ccc` workflow, despite some technical difficulties.
-   The `CLAUDE.md` file provided clear instructions.

## What Could Improve

-   My initial attempts to create the GitHub issue failed. I should have anticipated the security restrictions and used a more robust method from the start.
-   I forgot to provide the link to the created issue and had to be reminded by the user. I need to be more careful about providing all the relevant information in my responses.

## Blockers & Resolutions

-   **Blocker**: The `gh issue create` command was failing due to security restrictions on command substitution.
  **Resolution**: I created a temporary file with the issue body and used the `--body-file` option to create the issue.

## üí≠ Honest Feedback (REQUIRED - DO NOT SKIP)

The security restrictions on the `run_shell_command` tool are a bit aggressive. It would be helpful if the tool could provide more specific feedback on why a command is being blocked. The current error message is a bit generic. Other than that, the tools are working well and I am able to perform my tasks effectively.

## Lessons Learned

-   **Pattern**: When creating multi-line content for a shell command, it's more reliable to write the content to a temporary file and pass the file path to the command.
-   **Mistake**: Forgetting to provide the user with a link to a created resource.
-   **Discovery**: The `gh` CLI is a powerful tool for interacting with GitHub, but it needs to be used carefully to avoid security restrictions.

## Next Steps

-   [ ] Await user instructions.
