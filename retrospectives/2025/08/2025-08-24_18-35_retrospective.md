**Session Date**: 2025-08-24
**Start Time**: 01:09 GMT+7 (18:09 UTC)
**End Time**: 01:35 GMT+7 (18:35 UTC)
**Duration**: ~26 minutes
**Primary Focus**: Fix PocketBase Pet Tracker Data Loading Issues
**Session Type**: Bug Fix / Feature Completion
**Current Issue**: #6 (Fix Pet Tracker Data Loading Issues)
**Last PR**: None (working on feat/issue-5-complete-pet-tracker-implementation branch)
**Export**: retrospectives/exports/session_2025-08-24_18-35.md

## Session Summary
Successfully diagnosed and fixed critical JSVM scoping issues preventing pet tracker data import. Discovered PocketBase executes hooks in separate VM contexts, requiring functions to be defined inside hook handlers. Fixed API endpoint parameter issues and achieved full functionality with all 28 pet tags importing successfully.

## Timeline
- 01:09 - Started session, reviewed previous retrospective and Issue #5
- 01:10 - Created Issue #6 with comprehensive fix plan
- 01:14 - First attempt to fix with routerUse pattern (failed - onServe not defined)
- 01:18 - Second attempt with onServe (failed - not a global function)
- 01:21 - Third attempt with onBootstrap (failed - setTimeout not available)
- 01:22 - Fourth attempt (failed - function scoping issue discovered)
- 01:24 - Deep dive into PocketBase JSVM documentation and source
- 01:27 - Discovered critical insight: PocketBase uses separate VMs for loading vs execution
- 01:30 - Fixed by defining function INSIDE onBootstrap - SUCCESS! 28 records imported
- 01:32 - Fixed API endpoints by replacing findFirstRecordByFilter with findRecordsByFilter
- 01:33 - Validated GPS precision (15 decimals) and deduplication working
- 01:35 - All systems operational, creating retrospective

## Technical Details

### Files Modified
```
pb_hooks/pet_tracker_import.pb.js  # Fixed JSVM scoping
pb_hooks/pet_tracker_api.pb.js     # Fixed API parameter issues
```

### Key Code Changes
- **Import Hook**: Moved function definition INSIDE onBootstrap handler
- **API Endpoints**: Changed from `findFirstRecordByFilter` to `findRecordsByFilter` with limit 1
- **Error Handling**: Properly handled "no rows" as non-error condition
- **File Reading**: Kept character-by-character byte array conversion

### Architecture Decisions
- **Decision 1**: Functions must be defined inside hook handlers due to VM isolation
- **Decision 2**: Use `findRecordsByFilter` for sorted queries (findFirstRecordByFilter doesn't support sorting)
- **Decision 3**: Bootstrap hook is the correct place for initialization (onServe not available globally)
- **Decision 4**: No setTimeout in JSVM - execute immediately after e.next()

## üìù AI Diary (REQUIRED - DO NOT SKIP)
**‚ö†Ô∏è MANDATORY: This section provides crucial context for future sessions**

This session was a masterclass in systematic debugging! Started confidently after creating Issue #6, but immediately hit a wall with "onServe is not defined". My first instinct was to try different hook patterns - routerUse, onServe, various combinations. Each failure was puzzling.

The breakthrough came when I decided to investigate the JSVM implementation deeply. Using a parallel agent to search the PocketBase source, I discovered something critical: PocketBase doesn't concatenate .pb.js files - it executes them individually in a shared "loader" VM, but hook handlers run in separate "executor" VMs from a pool!

This explained EVERYTHING. Functions defined at the top level exist in the loader VM but aren't accessible in executor VMs. The solution was elegant: define the function INSIDE the onBootstrap handler where it's needed.

The moment I saw "Import complete: 28 new, 0 duplicates, 0 errors" I felt such relief. Then immediately hit another issue with the API - but this time I knew to check the exact function signatures. Turns out findFirstRecordByFilter doesn't accept sorting parameters the way I was using them.

What really struck me was how PocketBase's architecture is quite sophisticated - using VM pools for isolation - but the documentation doesn't make this clear. Without diving into the source code, I would never have understood why the function wasn't accessible.

## What Went Well
- Systematic debugging approach - tried multiple patterns methodically
- Used parallel agent effectively to search PocketBase source
- Discovered root cause through source code analysis
- Fixed both import and API issues in single session
- All 28 pet tags importing successfully
- GPS precision preserved (15+ decimals)
- Deduplication working perfectly

## What Could Improve
- Should have checked JSVM architecture documentation first
- Wasted time trying setTimeout (not available in JSVM)
- Could have checked function signatures more carefully initially
- Need to document PocketBase quirks better in CLAUDE.md

## Blockers & Resolutions
- **Blocker**: Function not defined error in JSVM execution
  **Resolution**: Define functions inside hook handlers, not at top level

- **Blocker**: onServe not available as global function
  **Resolution**: Use onBootstrap for initialization

- **Blocker**: findFirstRecordByFilter sorting parameter error
  **Resolution**: Use findRecordsByFilter with limit 1 instead

## üí≠ Honest Feedback (REQUIRED - DO NOT SKIP)
**‚ö†Ô∏è MANDATORY: This section ensures continuous improvement**

This session highlighted a fundamental gap in PocketBase documentation. The JSVM isolation model is NOT intuitive - most developers would expect functions defined in the same file to be accessible. The fact that loading and execution happen in different VM contexts is a critical architectural detail that's buried in the source code.

I'm proud of how I handled the debugging - instead of randomly trying things, I dove deep into the source to understand WHY it wasn't working. The parallel agent search was brilliant for finding the VM pool implementation details.

The API fix was almost anticlimactic after the JSVM discovery. Once I understood the parameter order issue, it was straightforward. But I should have been more careful reading the type definitions initially.

What frustrated me most was the time spent on dead ends (routerUse, onServe, setTimeout). Each seemed logical but failed for different reasons. PocketBase's JavaScript environment is NOT standard Node.js - it's Goja (Go's JavaScript engine) with specific limitations.

The session felt like detective work - following clues, hitting dead ends, then finding the smoking gun in the source code. Very satisfying when it all clicked together!

## Lessons Learned
- **JSVM Architecture**: PocketBase uses separate VMs for loading (.pb.js files) vs execution (hook handlers)
- **Function Scope**: Always define functions INSIDE hook handlers, not at top level
- **Available Hooks**: onBootstrap is global, onServe is not (must use $app.onServe())
- **No setTimeout**: JSVM doesn't have setTimeout, setInterval, or other async timer functions
- **API Signatures**: findFirstRecordByFilter takes (collection, filter, ...params) - no sorting
- **Sorting Records**: Use findRecordsByFilter with limit 1 for sorted single record queries

## Next Steps
- [x] Pet tracker fully operational
- [ ] Create PR for completed implementation
- [ ] Document JSVM quirks in CLAUDE.md
- [ ] Add validation scripts to repo
- [ ] Consider adding error recovery for failed imports
- [ ] Monitor cron job performance over time
