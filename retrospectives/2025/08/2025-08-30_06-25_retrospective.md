## Session Summary
Reviewed all prior retrospectives (2025-08-24 ‚Üí 2025-08-30) to extract cross-session patterns, recurring issues, strengths, and concrete next steps. Findings were consolidated to guide upcoming hardening and cleanup work.

## Timeline
- 13:20 - Enumerated all RRR files in retrospectives/2025/08
- 13:22 - Synthesized patterns, risks, improvements, and actions
- 13:25 - Recorded meta-analysis retrospective

## Technical Details

### Files Reviewed
```
retrospectives/2025/08/*_retrospective.md (10 files)
```

### Key Cross-Cutting Findings
- Simplicity-first development aligns with user preference; incremental delivery over comprehensive upfront plans
- PocketBase JSVM quirks: define functions inside handlers, no timers, require() inside handlers, use e.requestInfo()
- Data import pipeline is close: data_imports created; ensure post-create processing writes to pet_locations and updates status/counters
- Hashing: client-provided MD5 trusted in /recv; unify and compute canonical server-side; align location_hash between DB and DuckDB
- JSON fields: e.record.get(json_field) needs JSON.parse() due to byte-array-like behavior
- API endpoints: GraphQL-style pagination and numeric IDs well-received; endpoints currently archived
- Ops tooling: strong validation, security audit, cron/export; minor portability issues (md5 vs md5sum, absolute file paths)

## üìù AI Diary (REQUIRED - DO NOT SKIP)
I read through the entire RRR history to avoid repeating past mistakes and to surface the next highest-leverage improvements. A clear narrative emerges: we learned the hard way how PB‚Äôs JSVM works, then codified those lessons into working utilities and safer patterns. The remaining gaps concentrate at the ingestion trust boundary (hashing) and completing the `data_imports` ‚Üí `pet_locations` flow. The archived API is ready to be promoted once those foundations are solid. The RRRs themselves are rich and mostly complete; a few placeholders and missing ‚ÄúExport‚Äù artifacts should be tidied to keep the historical trail crisp.

## What Went Well
- Strong ops hygiene and practical scripts
- Consistent schema/index design and dedup strategy
- Rapid learning curve on JSVM; utilities captured best practices
- API design decisions (GraphQL-style pagination, numeric IDs) are coherent

## What Could Improve
- Compute and enforce server-side content hashing in /recv
- Complete import processing and persist status/counters
- Align hashing formulas across DB and DuckDB exports
- Make importer scripts fully portable (paths, md5sum fallback)
- Activate archived API routes using shared utils and indexes
- Clean up RRR placeholders and ensure referenced exports exist

## Blockers & Resolutions
- **Blocker**: Trusting client-provided MD5 enables spoofed dedup
  **Resolution**: Compute canonical hash server-side from JSON string and dedup on it

## üí≠ Honest Feedback (REQUIRED - DO NOT SKIP)
The RRR discipline is paying dividends‚Äîmistakes are not repeating, and patterns are being reused correctly. The few remaining risks are concentrated and tractable. Converting these findings into small, focused PRs will compound quality quickly.

## Lessons Learned
- **Pattern**: Use source-of-truth patterns‚Äî`e.requestInfo()`, in-handler `require`, and handler-scoped functions
- **Security**: Treat client MD5 as advisory; compute canonical hash for dedup/integrity
- **Consistency**: Standardize hashing across components to avoid subtle dedup mismatches
- **Hygiene**: Keep retrospectives free of placeholders; ensure linked artifacts exist

## Next Steps
- [ ] Implement server-side content hashing in `/recv`
- [ ] Finish `data_imports` post-create processing and status updates
- [ ] Unify `location_hash` formula in server and DuckDB
- [ ] Make `import_tags.sh` portable and repo-relative
- [ ] Promote pet API routes from archive and align with utils
- [ ] Clean RRR placeholders and generate missing exports
