**Export**: retrospectives/exports/session_2025-08-30_06-10.md

## Session Summary
Reviewed the repository and CLAUDE.md, surveyed active and archived PocketBase hooks, analyzed the vendored PocketBase source structure, and produced a comprehensive code + PB source report. Opened a GitHub context issue to capture the report and recommendations.

## Timeline
- 13:00 - Opened CLAUDE.md and scanned repo structure
- 13:03 - Reviewed active hooks, migrations, and scripts
- 13:06 - Skimmed PocketBase source (plugins/jsvm, apis/*, tools/*)
- 13:08 - Wrote structured report and created GH issue #54
- 13:10 - Prepared retrospective

### Key Code Changes
- Added a detailed review report covering:
  - App code strengths, risks, and quick wins
  - PocketBase source strengths and quirks (JSVM, router, tooling)

### Architecture Decisions
- Deferred: No structural changes in this session (analysis-only).

## üìù AI Diary (REQUIRED - DO NOT SKIP)
I began by grounding in CLAUDE.md to align with your short codes and safety workflow, then scanned the project to map active PocketBase hooks, migrations, and scripts. The flow of ingest ‚Üí `data_imports` ‚Üí (intended) `pet_locations` plus a DuckDB export pipeline makes sense; utilities in `pb_hooks/utils.js` show good boundaries and defensive DB access. While reviewing the `POST /recv` import handler, the reliance on a client-supplied MD5 stood out as a trust-boundary risk; I flagged computing a server-side content hash as a top priority. I also noticed the `onRecordCreate` hook currently just logs and doesn‚Äôt process `json_content` into `pet_locations`, so I recommended closing that loop and persisting processed/duplicate/error counts to the record‚Äôs status.

To understand runtime constraints and validate assumptions, I skimmed the vendored PocketBase source‚Äîespecially the JSVM plugin (goja integration) and router. It reinforced the documented quirks: executor VMs, no timers, and request parsing via `e.requestInfo()`. Those ‚Äúgotchas‚Äù are consistent, not bugs, and are already reflected in your Lessons Learned. After synthesizing findings, I wrote a comprehensive report and opened a GitHub context issue to preserve it. One hiccup: labeling failed because the label didn‚Äôt exist; I retried without labels and it succeeded. Overall, the codebase is in good shape with a few high-leverage hardening steps.

## What Went Well
- Clear separation of concerns in utilities and migrations
- Practical ops scripts for validation, security, cron, and exports
- PocketBase source is modern and well organized; JSVM plugin design is strong

## What Could Improve
- Compute server-side content hash for import deduplication
- Complete `data_imports` ‚Üí `pet_locations` processing and status updates
- Unify `location_hash` formula across DB and DuckDB exports
- Make `import_tags.sh` fully portable (path + md5sum fallback)
- Promote and align archived pet API routes with shared utils

## Blockers & Resolutions
- **Blocker**: Could not add non-existent GitHub label during issue creation
  **Resolution**: Created issue without labels (issue #54)

## üí≠ Honest Feedback (REQUIRED - DO NOT SKIP)
The project‚Äôs foundations are strong and thoughtfully documented. The CLAUDE short codes help drive clarity; wiring small wrapper scripts for `ccc/nnn/gogogo/rrr` would make them frictionless. The biggest gap is trust hardening at the ingestion boundary; computing the content hash server-side is low effort, high value. The archived API is a good start‚Äîbringing it into active hooks and reusing `utils` will keep things DRY. On the PB side, the JSVM constraints are unusual if you expect Node, but the plugin is consistent and well engineered; your notes already capture the needed mindset shift.

## Lessons Learned
- Pattern: Treat client-provided hashes as hints only; compute server-side canonical hashes for dedup and integrity.
- Pattern: Close ingestion loops fully‚Äîpersist processing outcomes (processed/duplicates/errors) to import records.
- Discovery: PB‚Äôs `e.requestInfo()` provides the most reliable body/headers access in hooks.
- Mistake to avoid: Divergent hashing formulas across pipeline components (DB vs export) cause subtle dedup mismatches.

## Next Steps
- [ ] Compute server-side content hash in `/recv` and dedup on it
- [ ] Implement `data_imports` create-hook processing and status/count updates
- [ ] Standardize `location_hash` across server and DuckDB
- [ ] Make `import_tags.sh` portable and repo-relative
- [ ] Activate pet API endpoints using shared utils and indexes
