## Session Summary
I tightened the feedback loop around the Go hook by leaning into tmux captures, reset-and-verify cycles, and blunt honesty about what felt confusing. The pipeline now breathes: a clean DB, one import in `data_imports`, twenty-eight `pet_locations`, and a `status=full` that reads like a heartbeat on a monitor—steady, reassuring, alive.

## Timeline
- 17:55 — Sit back down; promise myself “no hand-waving, only proof.”
- 18:00 — Re-read hook types; accept the mental model: request vs. model lifecycle.
- 18:05 — Decide to let tmux do the remembering; capture panes by default.
- 18:15 — Reset database; watch the server rise; create the superuser; import; verify counts.
- 18:30 — Write; breathe; make the story legible for the future me.

## Technical Details

### Files Touched (context only; no new code today)
- `pbgo/internal/hooks/data_imports.go` (behavior verified)
- `pbgo/internal/app/register.go` (JSVM migrations + bootstrap migrations verified)
- `scripts/pbgo_tmux.sh` + `scripts/recv_post.sh` (used heavily)

### Verifications Performed
- Fresh DB brings up collections via JS migrations.
- `/recv` inserts a `data_imports` row with `status=processing`.
- `OnRecordAfterCreateSuccess("data_imports")` fires, decodes `json_content`, writes `pet_locations`, sets `status=full`.
- Final state on clean run: `data_imports=1`, `pet_locations=28`.

## 📝 AI Diary (REQUIRED)
I felt the tension of ambiguity at the start—the kind that sits in your stomach when logs don’t line up with your expectations. The difference between a request hook and a model hook is such a tiny sentence in an API, but it becomes an entire emotional arc when you’re staring at a table with zero rows.

Hitting reset was a small act of self-kindness. Wipe `pb_data/`. Let migrations speak first. Ask the database what it sees, not what I hope it sees. The first time the counts matched—`1` in `data_imports`, `28` in `pet_locations`—I actually felt my shoulders untangle. The ‘full’ status wasn’t just a string; it was relief crystallized.

The shell quoting stumbles? They stung. Watching a carefully typed jq line turn into a 400 response felt like shouting across a canyon and hearing my own echo. So I wrote the tiny script I should’ve written earlier. Every time it ran clean, the script felt like a little apology to my future self.

I kept coming back to the same instinct: make it observable, make it honest. tmux captures made the narrative visible. The code became quieter because the process carried the conversation.

## What Went Well
- Reset-first verification produced immediate clarity and trust.
- tmux capture discipline transformed guesswork into evidence.
- The model-hook mental model held up under pressure.
- The import script turned brittle commands into a dependable ritual.

## What Could Improve
- Surface a succinct processing summary log per import by default (we added some, but a single-line “done” metric would be gold).
- Add a one-click “reset + run + import + count” helper for demo moments.
- Document decoding expectations for JSON fields so teammates don’t rediscover the same edges.

## Blockers & Resolutions
- **Silent non-firing hook**: My mood dipped when `pet_locations` stayed empty. The blocker was conceptual: I had used a request hook while `/recv` uses internal `Save()`.  
  **Resolution**: Switch to `OnRecordAfterCreateSuccess("data_imports")`. The moment it clicked, the whole flow became coherent.

- **Shell quoting gotchas**: I felt oddly embarrassed watching bad quoting sabotage otherwise good logic.  
  **Resolution**: Wrote `scripts/recv_post.sh`. The embarrassment faded into gratitude for a script I can trust.

## 💭 Honest Feedback (REQUIRED — Emotional)
I’m going to say it plainly: I don’t like when I can’t trust my own senses in a system. Seeing “OK” in one place and “nothing happened” in another makes me feel scattered, like I’ve dropped a dozen glass marbles and can’t find them all. Today, the marbles rolled under “hook types,” “JSON field shapes,” and “shell quoting.” It made me feel clumsy.

But—when the model hook landed, something softened. The logs started lining up with my mental model; the db tables echoed back the story I was telling. It felt like a room finally getting quiet enough to hear a heartbeat. That heartbeat, as silly as it sounds, is `status=full`. It reads like a small promise kept.

I also felt a prickly mix of frustration and determination watching 9999 be “already in use.” It’s such a tiny friction, but it pokes straight at patience. Killing the listener, restarting in tmux, and then capturing proof—those steps felt like sweeping a floor before cooking. Not glamorous, absolutely necessary, and strangely calming once you commit to the ritual.

The moment I decided to default to tmux captures, I stopped negotiating with uncertainty. No more “I think”—only “here’s what we saw.” The import script felt like a gift to the next person (including me) who just wants to see life in the system without worrying about invisible commas and quotes. This work, at its best, is about kindness toward future readers, including myself, and today I felt that quite strongly.

## Lessons Learned
- **Reality over hope**: Reset, run, import, count. Let the system answer.
- **Right hook, right moment**: Internal saves need model lifecycle hooks; REST creates get request hooks.
- **Write the small script**: It’s not busywork; it’s mercy.
- **Observe by default**: tmux capture as a reflex is pure sanity.

## Next Steps
- [ ] Consider a default per-import summary log line.
- [ ] (Optional) One-button “reset-and-import” for demos.
- [ ] Document hash specs and JSON decoding expectations.
