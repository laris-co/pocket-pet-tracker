## Session Summary
We scaffolded a native Go PocketBase app (`pbgo/`) that mirrors the existing JS hooks. We wired a Go HTTP route for `/recv` and a record lifecycle hook to process `data_imports` into `pet_locations`. We added tmux automation, started the server on port 9999, created a superuser, and validated the full pipeline from import to processed locations. Final counts on a fresh DB: `data_imports: 1`, `pet_locations: 28`, with import status set to `full`.

## Timeline
- 10:00 ‚Äî Reviewed repo, CLAUDE.md short‚Äëcode rules (ccc/nnn/gogogo).
- 10:10 ‚Äî Opened plan (#68) and scaffolded Go app (`pbgo/`), `/recv` handler, and import hook.
- 10:30 ‚Äî Opened PR #69 and pushed feature branch `feat/go-port-hooks`.
- 10:40 ‚Äî Added JSVM migrations loading (hooks disabled) and `RunAppMigrations()` on bootstrap.
- 10:50 ‚Äî Added tmux helper (`scripts/pbgo_tmux.sh`) and `scripts/recv_post.sh`, started server on :9999.
- 11:00 ‚Äî First import inserted into `data_imports` but no `pet_locations` rows; investigated hook firing.
- 11:05 ‚Äî Root cause: used `OnRecordCreateRequest`, which doesn‚Äôt fire for internal `app.Save()` used by `/recv`.
- 11:10 ‚Äî Switched to `OnRecordAfterCreateSuccess("data_imports")`; robust JSON decoding of `json_content`.
- 11:15 ‚Äî Cleaned DB, restarted server, created superuser, posted import, verified `pet_locations = 28`, `status = full`.
- 11:20 ‚Äî Captured tmux panes and wrapped up with this retrospective.

## Technical Details

### Files Modified/Added
```
pbgo/cmd/pbgo/main.go
pbgo/internal/app/register.go
pbgo/internal/handlers/recv.go
pbgo/internal/hooks/data_imports.go
pbgo/internal/utils/{jsonhash.go,location.go,pet.go}
scripts/pbgo_tmux.sh
scripts/recv_post.sh
```

### Key Code Changes
- `POST /recv` (Go): computes canonical `content_hash = md5(stableStringify(content))`, dedupes by hash, saves `data_imports` with `status=processing`.
- Hook: moved to `OnRecordAfterCreateSuccess("data_imports")` so it fires after internal `app.Save()`. Parses `json_content` (handles `[]any`, `string`, `[]byte`, and `types.JSONRaw`), filters by `Tag N`, dedupes by `location_hash`, saves `pet_locations` with `import_id`, and sets import `status` (`full|partial/duplicate/error`).
- App bootstrap: load JS migrations via JSVM, disable JS hooks (`HooksFilesPattern: ^$`), run `RunAppMigrations()`.
- Hashes:
  - `content_hash`: canonical JSON MD5 (key‚Äësorted stringify).
  - `location_hash`: md5(pet_name + latitude + longitude + accuracy) ‚Äî excludes timestamp to align with DuckDB exports.
- Tooling: tmux helper to run server in pane 0 and commands in pane 1; `recv_post.sh` to avoid jq quoting pitfalls.

### Architecture Decisions
- Use model lifecycle hook (`OnRecordAfterCreateSuccess`) instead of request‚Äëscoped hook, since `/recv` uses internal save and not the public create endpoint.
- Keep JSVM only for migrations; disable JS hooks during rollout to avoid duplicate processing.
- Stable JSON hashing to prevent dedup drift due to key order.
- Exclude timestamp from `location_hash` for cross‚Äësystem consistency; can revisit if required.

## üìù AI Diary (REQUIRED)
I began by mapping your JS hooks and utilities, then built a small Go sub‚Äëapp to mirror that behavior: a route for `/recv` and a post‚Äëcreate hook. The first run ‚Äúworked‚Äù for inserts but didn‚Äôt populate `pet_locations`. Reading PocketBase‚Äôs source clarified the distinction: request‚Äëscoped hooks trigger on REST creates, whereas internal saves trigger model lifecycle hooks. That was the turning point‚Äîswitching to `OnRecordAfterCreateSuccess("data_imports")` aligned events with how `/recv` persists data.

Another subtlety was `json_content`. The DB exposes it as `types.JSONRaw` (or sometimes a string/[]byte), not directly as `[]any`. Without robust decoding the hook would see ‚Äúno items.‚Äù I implemented conservative decode paths for all likely shapes, and defended with early error ‚Üí status `error`.

Operationally, tmux helped enormously. Separating the server pane from the command pane made it easy to inspect logs while running `curl`, `sqlite3`, and the helper scripts. A few early attempts failed due to shell quoting (jq) and path assumptions; the helper script eliminated that class of error. Once the DB was reset and the server restarted, the full pipeline came together: import row created with `processing`, hook fired and wrote 28 location rows, `status` updated to `full`.

The last checks were about hashing and migration presence. Loading JS migrations with hooks disabled ensured schema existed without double logic. Logging inside the hook made tmux captures clearer, but I kept logs minimal to avoid noise.

## What Went Well
- Identified the exact hook type mismatch quickly and corrected it.
- Robust JSON decoding eliminated silent no‚Äëop processing.
- tmux automation made server/command separation reproducible and observable.
- Clean DB reset ‚Üí deterministic validation (`imports=1`, `locations=28`, `status=full`).

## What Could Improve
- Add targeted logging around import processing summary by default (kept minimal today).
- Consolidate hash spec in code docs and DuckDB SQL with a single source of truth.
- Provide a single ‚Äúreset‚Äëand‚Äëimport‚Äù script to reduce multi‚Äëstep manual sequences.

## Blockers & Resolutions
- **Hook didn‚Äôt fire**: Used `OnRecordCreateRequest` (REST) but `/recv` does internal `Save`. 
  **Resolution**: Switched to `OnRecordAfterCreateSuccess("data_imports")` (model lifecycle). 
- **json_content not decoded**: Received `types.JSONRaw`/`[]byte` rather than `[]any`. 
  **Resolution**: Added robust decoding paths and fallback to single‚Äëobject wrap.
- **Port contention & quoting**: :9999 already bound; jq quoting in tmux. 
  **Resolution**: Kill listeners; use `recv_post.sh` helper & tmux capture always.

## üí≠ Honest Feedback (REQUIRED)
The separation of hook types in PocketBase (request vs. model) is powerful but can be a trap if you don‚Äôt think from the persistence path backward. Once I focused on how the record is saved, the solution was straightforward. The JSVM environment differences (JSON field types) deserve explicit handling; relying on implicit conversion was brittle.

Operationally, being strict about tmux capture made every step auditable. The only rough edges were shell quoting and path assumptions‚Äîmoved to helpers quickly. The design tradeoff to exclude timestamp from `location_hash` increases dedup across identical coordinates but may compress high‚Äëfrequency samples; it matches your DuckDB exports and is a reasonable default.

## Lessons Learned
- **Pattern**: Use model lifecycle hooks for internally saved records; request‚Äëscoped hooks only for REST endpoints.
- **Gotcha**: PocketBase JSON fields in Go arrive as `types.JSONRaw`/`[]byte`; always decode explicitly.
- **Ops**: Automate tmux workflows; capture panes right after sends; avoid inline jq with complex quoting.
- **Consistency**: Decide hash formula once and align all producers/consumers.

## Next Steps
- [ ] Optionally add an end‚Äëto‚Äëend `scripts/reset_and_import.sh` that resets DB, restarts server, creates superuser, posts import, and prints counts.
- [ ] Document hash specs (content_hash, location_hash) in README/CLAUDE.md.
- [ ] Decide whether to log per‚Äëimport summaries by default in production.
